# KhanAcademyCaseStudy
In this case study, the primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Khan Academy platform's user retention and engagement. The underlying approach involves leveraging a diverse set of data points, including user demographic information, activity data, content metrics, retention status, and more, to gain valuable insights into the platform's performance.

The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to user retention, identifying areas of improvement, and formulating data-driven recommendations to enhance the platform's overall effectiveness. By examining user behavior, content preferences, engagement triggers, and other key metrics, the goal is to make informed decisions that lead to increased user retention, improved user experience, and sustained growth in the platform's user base.

Basically, I am interested in learning about the behavioral patterns of users in their first month of usage, particularly for any leading indicators of longer term engagement and retention on the platform.
